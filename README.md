Sudoku Champ ("the App") is developed by the Sudoku Champ team ("we", "us", or "our"). This privacy policy describes how we handle information when you use the App.

## Information We Collect

### Information collected by Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)

The App displays banner and interstitial advertisements provided by Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). AdMob may automatically collect device information (such as device identifiers, IP address, and information about other apps on your device), approximate location, and data about your interaction with ads to personalize and measure ads. We do not control the specific data that AdMob collects.

You can learn more about how Google uses data from AdMob by visiting the [Google Privacy \& Terms site](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).

### Information you provide to us

We do not require you to create an account or submit personal information to play Sudoku Champ. The App stores your gameplay state (such as puzzle progress, settings, and notification preferences) locally on your device. This information is not transmitted to our servers.

## How We Use Information

We use locally stored gameplay data solely to operate core features of the App, such as continuing your game, providing hints, and sending optional reminder notifications. We do not sell or share this information with third parties.

Advertising partners such as Google may use the data they collect to deliver and improve ads shown in the App. Their use of information is governed by their own privacy policies.

## Data Retention

Locally stored gameplay information remains on your device until you clear the App's data or uninstall it. We do not retain this information on external servers.

AdMob retains advertising data in accordance with Google's policies. Please review Google's documentation for retention details.

## Children's Privacy

Sudoku Champ is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

## Your Choices

* **Ad personalization**: You can opt out of personalized ads from Google by following the instructions provided in the Google Privacy \& Terms site linked above or by adjusting your device settings.
* **Notifications**: You can enable or disable reminder notifications in the App's settings or through your device's notification preferences.
* **Data deletion**: You can delete the gameplay data stored on your device by clearing the App's data or uninstalling the App.

## Security

We implement reasonable safeguards within the App to protect locally stored data. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of material changes by updating this document's effective date and providing notice within the App when appropriate.
